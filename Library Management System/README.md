### Digital Library Management System

The **Digital Library Management System** automates every function of a library, from book-keeping to issuing, fine generation, advance booking, and report generation. It is a web-based project that ensures all library operations are handled digitally and efficiently, with a centralized database to manage all the details.

#### Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide a fully automated library system, digitizing every process involved. With this system, users can manage all operations, including:

- Book management (adding, updating, deleting, and viewing records)
- Issuing and returning books
- Fine calculation for overdue books
- Advance booking for books that are currently unavailable
- Report generation for admin and users

The user-friendly interface makes it easy for both technical and non-technical users to navigate the system without difficulty.

#### Key Modules

- **Admin Module**: 
  The admin has full control over the system. Admin privileges include:
  - Adding, updating, or deleting records for books and members.
  - Managing user accounts and their book-issuing details.
  - Generating reports and viewing overall library activity.

- **User Module**: 
  Regular users have limited access. They can:
  - View available books by browsing categories or searching by title/author.
  - Issue or return books as per library policy.
  - Make advance bookings for books currently unavailable.
  - Use the email option to raise any queries directly with the library admin.

#### Benefits

- Fully automated, web-based library system.
- Centralized database for easy management of books and users.
- User-friendly interface, suitable for non-technical users.
- Reduces manual efforts for librarians and simplifies book issuing/returning for users.
