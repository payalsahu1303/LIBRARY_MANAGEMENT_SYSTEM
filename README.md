# OIBSIP Internship Projects

Welcome to my **Oasis Infobyte** internship projects repository. This repository showcases the Java development projects I worked on during my internship, including an **Online Reservation System** and a **Digital Library Management** system.

## Project Overview

During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I focused on developing Java-based applications that solve real-world problems. The two key projects showcased in this repository are:

1. **Online Reservation System**: A user-friendly application for booking and managing reservations.
2. **Digital Library Management**: A system for managing library resources, allowing easy access to books, journals, and other materials.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- MySQL
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
- User Interface (UI) Design (Swing/JavaFX)

## Projects

### Online Reservation System

The **Online Reservation System** allows users to make reservations for services, view existing bookings, and manage their reservations. Key features include:

- User registration and login
- Reservation creation, modification, and cancellation
- Admin panel for managing reservations and users
- Database integration using MySQL

### Digital Library Management

The **Digital Library Management** system helps libraries to manage their book collections, issue books, and track returns. It offers the following features:

- User registration and login
- Book search, issue, and return management
